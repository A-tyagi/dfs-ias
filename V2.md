## On Clone
1. Download Docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. On the root directory, run `docker-compose up` -- this will build and run the Docker containers for API, MySql, and Adminer (will take a while on first run).
3. Once everything is done loading, you can use Adminer to migrate the database.
- Go to `localhost:8080` on your browser.
- Enter the db credentials.
- Click 'SQL command'
- Copy and Paste the SQL commands to create the 'dfs' database and tables
4. You should be able to use the API on `localhost:3306`


### Troubleshooting
- You can use `docker-compose down` to remove the container.
